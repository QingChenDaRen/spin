Launch this script using:

python luigi_fit.py LaunchAll --workers 30 (or any number)

with luigid (server) running in the background. This uses the central-scheduler.

--workers will enable parallel processing of a single workers load.

path_to_data - This is the path to the data
path_to_rundir - This is where the tcl_script is run from. Background files and the MiD ordered lists should be saved in this folder. 
The text files containing the parameters values for each data file which are output from the model-fitting run will be saved here.

The tcl_script and list of observations should be in the same folder as the luigi_fit.py.
