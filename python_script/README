Launch this script using:

python parallel_model_fit.py LaunchAll --workers 30 (or any number of workers needed)

with luigid (server) running in the background. This allows use of the central-scheduler.

--workers enables parallel processing.

path_to_data - This is the path to the data
path_to_rundir - This is the directory where the tcl_script is run from. Background files and the MiD ordered lists should 
be saved within this folder. The text files containing the parameters values for each data file which are output from 
the model-fitting run will also be saved here.

The tcl_script and list of observations should be in the same folder as the luigi_fit.py.
